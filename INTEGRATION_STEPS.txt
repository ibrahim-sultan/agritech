ðŸ”— FRONTEND-BACKEND INTEGRATION STEPS

âœ… COMPLETED:
- Backend deployed: https://agrictech-3rfg.onrender.com
- Frontend deployed: https://agrictech01.netlify.app
- CORS updated to allow Netlify domain
- Environment variables prepared

ðŸŽ¯ NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE INTEGRATION:

1. UPDATE NETLIFY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
   Go to Netlify Dashboard â†’ Your Site â†’ Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   Add these variables:

   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://agrictech-3rfg.onrender.com/api
   REACT_APP_WS_URL=https://agrictech-3rfg.onrender.com
   REACT_APP_ENV=production
   REACT_APP_DEBUG=false

2. UPDATE RENDER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
   Go to Render Dashboard â†’ Your Service â†’ Environment
   Add or update:

   CLIENT_URL=https://agrictech01.netlify.app
   (This tells the backend which frontend domain to trust)

3. REDEPLOY BOTH SERVICES:
   - Netlify will auto-redeploy when you save environment variables
   - Render has already redeployed with latest code changes

4. TEST THE INTEGRATION:
   Visit: https://agrictech01.netlify.app
   
   âœ… Check if the app loads without JavaScript errors
   âœ… Open browser developer tools â†’ Network tab
   âœ… Try features that make API calls
   âœ… Verify API calls go to: https://agrictech-3rfg.onrender.com/api/*

5. VERIFY WEBSOCKET CONNECTION:
   âœ… Open browser console
   âœ… Look for: "ðŸ”Œ Connected to WebSocket server" message
   âœ… Should connect to: https://agrictech-3rfg.onrender.com

ðŸš¨ TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:

If you see CORS errors:
- Verify CLIENT_URL is set in Render
- Check browser console for exact error message
- Make sure both services are deployed with latest code

If API calls fail:
- Check Network tab in browser dev tools
- Verify environment variables in Netlify
- Test API directly: https://agrictech-3rfg.onrender.com/api/health

If the app shows "You need to enable JavaScript":
- This is normal - the app requires JavaScript to run
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser

ðŸ“‹ YOUR CURRENT URLS:
Frontend: https://agrictech01.netlify.app
Backend:  https://agrictech-3rfg.onrender.com
API:      https://agrictech-3rfg.onrender.com/api

ðŸŽ‰ ONCE COMPLETE:
Your AgriTech platform will be fully operational with:
- Frontend hosted on Netlify (fast CDN)
- Backend API hosted on Render (auto-scaling)
- Separate deployment pipeline
- Professional architecture
