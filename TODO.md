# Render Deployment Fix - Express Module Error

## Issue
- Error: "Cannot find module 'express'" when deploying to Render
- Root cause: Render deployment configuration doesn't properly handle monorepo structure

## Plan
- [x] Analyze current deployment configuration
- [x] Identify root cause (render.yaml + package.json mismatch)
- [x] Fix render.yaml configuration for monorepo structure
- [x] Update root package.json build process
- [ ] Test deployment configuration
- [ ] Verify Express module is found
- [ ] Confirm successful Render deployment

## Files Updated
- [x] render.yaml - Updated build command to ensure proper dependency installation
- [x] package.json (root) - Added Express dependencies and postinstall script
- [x] Verified server/package.json dependencies are intact

## Changes Made

### render.yaml
- Updated buildCommand: `npm install && npm run install-all && npm run build`
- This ensures all dependencies are installed before building

### package.json (root)
- Added all server dependencies to root package.json as backup
- Added postinstall script to automatically install subdirectory dependencies
- This provides redundancy in case Render has issues with the monorepo structure

## Status
âœ… Fixes Implemented - Ready for deployment testing

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push changes to your repository
2. Trigger a new deployment on Render
3. Monitor the build logs to ensure Express is found
4. Test the deployed application
