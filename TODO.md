# Render Deployment Fix - TODO List

## Issues to Fix:
- [x] Analyze current deployment configuration
- [ ] Add static file serving to server.js for production
- [ ] Update server/package.json with proper build scripts
- [ ] Create root package.json for Render deployment
- [ ] Update client API configuration for production
- [ ] Test build process locally
- [ ] Update deployment documentation

## Current Status:
- Identified "API endpoint not found" error on Render
- Server has all API routes configured correctly
- Missing static file serving for React build files
- Need proper build scripts for deployment

## Next Steps:
1. Update server.js to serve static files in production
2. Add build scripts to package.json files
3. Create root package.json for deployment
4. Test and verify fixes
