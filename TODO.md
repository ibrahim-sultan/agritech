# Fix Registration Issue

## Problem
Registration fails due to field mismatch between frontend and backend:
- Frontend sends `name` but backend expects `firstName` and `lastName`
- Frontend sends `location` but backend expects `profile.location.address`

## Tasks
- [x] Modify Register.js to use separate firstName and lastName fields
- [x] Update form state to handle firstName, lastName, and location properly
- [x] Update form submission to send correct data structure
- [x] Update server/routes/auth.js to properly handle profile.location.address
- [x] Test registration process

## Status
Completed âœ…

## Summary
- Fixed field mismatch between frontend and backend
- Updated registration form to send firstName, lastName, and location in correct format
- Server and client are now running successfully
- Registration should now work properly
